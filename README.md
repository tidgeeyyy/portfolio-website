## Project Overview

This repository holds the source code for my Web Development portfolio project. It is crafted entirely in HTML and encompasses various sections:

- **Header**: Features my profile picture and navigation links for easy access to different parts of the document.
- **About**: A brief insight into my background and my coding journey.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my past projects, including the technologies used and links to their GitHub repositories.
- **Skills**: A rundown of the technologies I’m proficient in and those I’m currently learning, presented with their respective skill levels.
- **Contact**: A placeholder section for contacting me through the website (not functional yet).
- **Footer**: Contains links to my social media profiles.

## How to Clone and Contribute

1. Ensure Git is installed and configured on your machine. For installation instructions, visit the official Git website.

2. Clone the repository with this command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tidgeeyyy/portfolio-website.git
    ```

    This action creates a local copy of the repository on your device.

3. Open your local copy using any IDE or text editor of your choice. If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the "Go Live" extension to enable a live server for real-time updates as you edit the files.

    To start the live server in Visual Studio Code, simply click the "Go Live" button (usually located at the bottom right). This will initiate the development server.
